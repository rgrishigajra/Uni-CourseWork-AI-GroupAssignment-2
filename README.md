**PART 1:**

IJK is a sliding tile game played on a 6x6 board by two players (either human or ai). First player is denoted by &#39;+&#39; and second player is denoted by &#39;-&#39;. To make the AI smart, **minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning** is implemented with a depth of 3.

Successors are possible for all four moves, that is UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT, and each successor is expanded in minimax function until terminal state is obtained or the final depth is reached. Alpha-beta pruning is used to avoid visiting unnecessary nodes further saving the computation time for the utility value of a branch. For each successor the current state gets a calculated utility value and using this value the best possible move is made.

**Utility value** is calculated based on current successor state, where the total sum is taken of multiplication of each cell value by the corresponding cell value of the weight matrix. To this sum a weighted value of empty tiles for that successor state is also added, giving the final utility value that is returned.

Now, each character in current board is converted into integer based on &#39; **transformplus&#39;** (when first player is AI) and &#39; **transformminus&#39;** (when second player is AI)  dictionaries. The current AI&#39;s characters have positive value and opponent&#39;s characters will have negative value.

The values of these dictionaries are as follows:

**transformplus** = {&#39;a&#39;: -2, &#39;b&#39;: -4, &#39;c&#39;: -8, &#39;d&#39;: -16, &#39;e&#39;: -32, &#39;f&#39;: -64, &#39;g&#39;: -128, &#39;h&#39;: -256, &#39;i&#39;: -512, &#39;j&#39;: -1024, &#39;k&#39;: -2048, &#39;A&#39;: 2, &#39;B&#39;: 4, &#39;C&#39;: 8, &#39;D&#39;: 16, &#39;E&#39;: 32, &#39;F&#39;: 64, &#39;G&#39;: 128, &#39;H&#39;: 256, &#39;I&#39;: 512, &#39;J&#39;: 1024, &#39;K&#39;: 2048}

**transformminus** = {&#39;a&#39;: 2, &#39;b&#39;: 4, &#39;c&#39;: 8, &#39;d&#39;: 16, &#39;e&#39;: 32, &#39;f&#39;: 64, &#39;g&#39;: 128, &#39;h&#39;: 256, &#39;i&#39;: 512, &#39;j&#39;: 1024, &#39;k&#39;: 2048, &#39;A&#39;: -2, &#39;B&#39;: -4, &#39;C&#39;: -8, &#39;D&#39;: -16, &#39;E&#39;: -32, &#39;F&#39;: -64, &#39;G&#39;: -128, &#39;H&#39;: -256, &#39;I&#39;: -512, &#39;J&#39;: -1024, &#39;K&#39;: -2048}

The weight matrix used to calculate the utility value is given below:

**weightMatrix** = [

[2048, 1024, 512, 256, 128, 64],

[1024, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32],

[512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16],

[256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8],

[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4],

 [64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2]

 ]

The weight matrix is selected in such a way that it has highest values concentrated in upper left corner, as which will help the AI to concentrate higher character value to be at upper left corner. This arrangement of having the highest tile concentrated in one corner makes it easier to combine other tiles in the board.

Number of empty tiles is also used to calculate the utility value, where for each empty tile, **(2048)****4**and this value was considered to have the empty tiles value comparable with the calculated weight value.

Thus, utility value is sum of the calculated weight value and the value of the empty tile, and this value is used by the minimax algorithm to maximize the chances of AI to win. Four utility values are obtained for the four moves possible from current state and the move with highest utility value is carried out as next move for AI.

Functions used in the code:

**weight() :** To calculate the weight value and the empty tiles value.

**convert()** : To convert the current board with characters into corresponding integers.

**utility() :** To calculate the successor&#39;s utility value.

**successor():** To get the successor of given state.

**miminmax():** Function that implements minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for current state of the game.

**next\_move():** Given function where the AI code is implemented and the decision regarding next move is made.

**Heuristics:**

Perhaps the majority of our time went out it is trying different heuristics, formulating them, researching them online and testing how the affected our AI algorithm with the latter part being quite tough. We considered the following heuristics:

1) **The snake-shaped heuristic**

[Referenced from: [http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2016/report/NieHouAn-AIPlays2048-report.pdf](http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2016/report/NieHouAn-AIPlays2048-report.pdf)
AI Plays 2048: _by Yun Nie (yunn), Wenqi Hou (wenqihou), Yicheng An (yicheng)]_

This heuristic seemed like a very good choice since it focused on getting larger values at one edge of the board which seems intuitive. But when we implemented the same with the powers of 2 the output was not promising. Our AI lost to the random AI half the times in 10 trials.

2) **The gradient heuristic**

Learning a bit from the above heuristic we tried converting the weighted matrix from above to a gradient matrix where a randomly picked corner would have the highest value and it gradually decreased to the opposite corner. We let the starting corner be of weight 2048 and it got halved on every both way with an opposite corner being 2. This gave us good results.

3) **The number of empty tiles**

[Referenced from: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22342854/what-is-the-optimal-algorithm-for-the-game-2048](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22342854/what-is-the-optimal-algorithm-for-the-game-2048) answered by Petr Mor√°vek (@xificurk)]

We thought of adding the number of tiles empty as a reward or giving a penalty for each tile being occupied. After trials, we ended up with rewarding the heuristic with a fixed value in the power of 2048 for every empty tile. We added a big weight here so as to push the algorithm towards merging as many tiles as possible.

4) **Monotonicity:**

Same reference as above.

We looked into making our matrix monotonic since this promoted the merging of tiles or increasing the likelihood of it. We weren&#39;t able to reach a conclusion of how this would factor in a two-player game since our Ai should not be helping the opponent. We didn&#39;t try to implement this heuristic.

5) **Adjacent tiles:**

We tried creating a penalty function that would try to push the algorithm to make the board a bit monotonic not entirely. The penalty function in our code (later we commented it out) tried to give a higher penalty for the bigger difference in sizes of adjacent tiles. So, if the tiles that are the same value are side by side this function gave no penalty, then for each step difference it gave more penalty. It was not so effective so ee didn&#39;t include it in our final algorithm.

**Final**

While testing we found that a combination of two heuristics worked well together: The number of empty tiles and Gradient weights. We could find a scale of both that was compatible and gave us 13 wins out of 15 vs the random Ai.
